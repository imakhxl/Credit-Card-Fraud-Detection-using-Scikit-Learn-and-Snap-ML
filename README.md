# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML

## Objective
The primary goal of this exercise is to build and compare machine learning models for credit card fraud detection using both Scikit-learn and Snap ML libraries.

## Dataset
You will be working with a real-world dataset containing credit card transactions from September 2013 involving European cardholders. The dataset will include features related to the transactions, and the target variable will indicate whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
 
## Models
The exercise focuses on implementing and evaluating two popular classification models:

Decision Tree: A tree-based model known for its interpretability.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful model often used for classification tasks.

## Libraries

Scikit-learn: A widely used Python library for machine learning.
Snap ML: An IBM library offering high-performance implementations of ML algorithms, including those for decision trees and SVMs.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models will be assessed based on their ability to accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate
